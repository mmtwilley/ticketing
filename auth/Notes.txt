Section 10: 

Test a single piece of code in isolation -> single middleware 
Test how different pieces of code work together -
Test how different components work together
Test how different services work together 

Testing Goals 
Basic Request Handling 
Some Test around models - unit testing
Event emitting + recieving 


Run these test directly directly from our terminal -> Implies that out local 
environment is capable of running each service -> Simple enough now, but
more complex projects might make this hard

Basic Request Handling for auth
